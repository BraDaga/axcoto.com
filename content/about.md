Thank you for visiting my corner. I'm Vinh, father of a girl and a boy,
husband and programmer.

I loves math, programming, manga and poem.

I mostly work on infrastructures and developer tools. My code are used
by developer for monitoring, debugging, inspecting purpose. My works is
to help other developer build better tools by building tool.

I have been developing software professionally since 2008. Being a
generalist, I can chime in and work across stack: front-end, back-end,
mobile, devops, whatever it takes to get the product success. I used
React a lot but venturing out into Svelve recently.

I'm interested in programming languages, compiler and intepreter design,
the core fundamental of computer like CPU, Network.

I know a wide range of languages and can chime in to work on anything.
The two languages that cause me a lot of time to wrap my head around
were Rust and Erlang.

I have very strong opnion on how to write software, as a result I'm big fan
of KISS.

I belive that programming is the best way for the poor to escape
poverty. It requires minimal capital to invest in equipments, yet
deliver an vast amount of power to run the web.

I runs a newsletter call
[BetterDev](https://betterdev.link), a weekly newsletter with links
about programming, video, some code repos to read and dev tools. You should
subscribe.

## Consultant

I run a [small DevOps consultancy](https://getopty.com), focus specially
on AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes but I can help anyone. I'm very proud of my
unique skill in Infrastructure and Coding skill so I can work on
anything.

My years of experience shipping software that require high uptime bring
me an opportunity to learn about building resilient softwares and
applied it to my client work
