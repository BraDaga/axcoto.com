I'm Vinh, a father of 2 cute girls, husband and programmer. I'm
passionate about programming.

I'm mostly working on infrastructure and building internal tool.
That means my code mostly use by developer for monitoring, debugging
purpose.

I love programming languages and know a wide range of language.
Currenly I'm dabble in Crystal, Elixir and Rust. I know Ruby, Go,
PHP and JavaScript quite well. Shell is my bread and butter.

I belive that programming is the only way for the poor to escape.
It requires minimal capital to invest in equipment, the limit is
your imagination.
