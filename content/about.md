Hi, I'm Vinh, father of 2 cute girls, husband and programmer.

I love programming, math, manga and poem.

I'm mostly working on infrastructure and building internal tools.
That means my code mostly use by developer for monitoring, debugging
purpose.

I'm interested in programming languages and know a wide range of language.
Currenly I'm dabble in Crystal, Elixir and Rust. I know Ruby, Go,
PHP and JavaScript quite well. Shell is my bread and butter. Time to
time, I hack on a toy Lisp language call [Mochi].

I belive that programming is the best way for the poor to escape
poverty. It requires minimal capital to invest in equipment, the limit
 is your imagination.

I run a newsletter call
[BetterDev](https://betterdev.link), a weekly newsletter with links
about programming, video, some code repos to read and dev tools. You should
subscribe.

## Consultant

I run a [small DevOps consultancy](https://yeo.space), focus specially
on AWS and Kubernetes. I help company to build a secure, scalable,
flexible enough infrastructure.

I develop and run [noty.im, a monitoring solution](https://noty.im) to
solve my pain point helping my client monitor their services. You should
check it out
