Hi, I'm Vinh, father of 2 cute girls, husband and programmer.

I love programming, math, manga and poem.

I'm mostly working on infrastructure and building internal tools.
That means my code mostly use by developer for monitoring, debugging
purpose.

I love programming languages and know a wide range of language.
Currenly I'm dabble in Crystal, Elixir and Rust. I know Ruby, Go,
PHP and JavaScript quite well. Shell is my bread and butter.

I belive that programming is the best way for the poor to escape
poverty. It requires minimal capital to invest in equipment, the limit
 is your imagination.

I run a newsletter call
[BetterDev](https://betterdev.link), a weekly newsletter with links
about programming, video, some code repos to read and dev tools. You should
subscribe.
