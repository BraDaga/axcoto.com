Hi, I'm Vinh, father of 2 cute girls, husband and programmer.

I'm from Vietnam but currently living in California but looking to
migrate to Japan or Swedeen soon.

I'm mostly working on infrastructure and building internal tool.
That means my code mostly use by developer for monitoring, debugging
purpose.

I love programming languages and know a wide range of language.
Currenly I'm dabble in Crystal, Elixir and Rust. I know Ruby, Go,
PHP and JavaScript quite well. Shell is my bread and butter.

I belive that programming is the only way for the poor to escape.
It requires minimal capital to invest in equipment, the limit is
your imagination.

I run a newsletter call
[BetterDev](https://betterdev.link), it has a weekly links of article,
video, some code repo to read and dev tools. You should subscribe.
