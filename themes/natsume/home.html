        I'm Vinh, glad to have you here on my internet life.<br/>
        I'm founder of <a href="https://getopty.com">Opty, a DevOps consultancy</a>, and <a href="https://mailwip.com">Mailwip</a>, an email forwarding service that is fast and reliable. If you have domains laying around, hook them up into Mailwip to receive and send email.<br/>
        I write to learn and share my experience with the world.
        My articles range from infrastructure to software design and slices of life.
        Every monday, I also send out a  newsletter call <a href="https://betterdev.link">BetterDev</a>, with links that help you become a better developer. You should subscribe.
